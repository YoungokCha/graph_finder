Graph-FINDER is a multimodal AI framework links literature mining with machine learning–based prediction to establish a scalable foundation for identifying optimal material candidates. In the database creation stage (blue), Graph-FINDER employs natural language processing, computer vision, and large language models to extract textual and graphical information from publications, converting fragmented literature into curated, machine-actionable datasets. These datasets enable application-aware prediction (orange), where models estimate candidate properties, benchmark them against device requirements, and uncover interpretable structure–property relationships. The synthesis and validation stage (green) is included as a prospective extension rather than a contribution of this work, representing future experimental realization and measurement of top-ranked candidates to refine the database. This envisioned feedback loop highlights the broader potential of Graph-FINDER for accelerating functional materials discovery.
